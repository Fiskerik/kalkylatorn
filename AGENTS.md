# AGENTS Instructions

These are the coding guidelines for this project. All contributors and assistants should apply these rules when editing code or documentation.

1. **Python Style**
   - Target Python 3.10 or later.
   - Use descriptive variable and function names.
   - Include docstrings for all public functions and classes.
   - Prefer list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate.

2. **Error Handling**
   - Avoid bare `except:` statements. Catch specific exceptions.
   - Do not suppress errors silently. Log or surface them as needed.

3. **Formatting**
   - Use Unix (LF) line endings for all files.
   - End each file with a single newline character.
   - Keep lines under 79 characters when practical.

4. **Documentation**
   - Update the README with any new dependencies or setup steps.
   - Comment complex logic in both Python and JavaScript files.

5. **Testing**
   - Run `python -m py_compile` on modified Python files to check syntax.
   - If tests exist, run them before committing changes.

These rules should be consulted before any code changes are proposed or implemented.
